
The federation has estimated an income of Tk 31.45cr to be generated from various sources while it aims to make up for the deficit with funding from sponsors and the government, said the federation's senior-vice president and chairman of finance committee, Abdus Salam Murshedy.

"We have approved our budget for 2024 today. The shortage will be secured from other sources including sponsors and the Ministry of Youth and Sports," Murshedy told reporters after the AGM.

The size of the budget for the current year is around more than Tk 5 cr from the last budget, which was placed in 2022, with the BFF unable to hold an AGM last due following the FIFA sanction on its general secretary. The previous budget, meanwhile, had a deficit of over Tk 8cr.

Murshedi said they are not worried about the deficit.

"Budget is always in deficit. If income is same as expenditure, then you would ask us about out contribution."

Meanwhile, the BFF, as expected, awarded councillorship to four clubs who finished in the top four of the recently-held women's football league, bringing the number of councillors to 151.

Hello, how are you?
